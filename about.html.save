		<h1>About us</h1>
		<hr />
		<p>
			Furnex.com aims to revolutionize the way quality used furniture is sold, discovered, and acquired today. 
			For sellers, listing your furniture has never been simpler. For buyers, we make finding the furniture you 
			want easy and getting it even easier.
		</p>
		<h1>Our Story</h1>
		<hr />
		<p>
			Furnex was started by four students who because of interesting roommates, even
			more interesting landlords, and depleting rent funds, were constantly moving
			throughout university. Moving around Toronto frequently led us to ask "Hey there 
			has to be a better way to buy and sell furniture online."  To us it just didn't
			make sense to buy and sell our furniture on the same site you could find cars,
			clothes, jobs, pets, or even friends.
		</p>
		<p>
			Buying and selling furniture online presents its own unique set of problems, which
			were simply not being addressed: What does the piece look like from this angle?
			What are its dimensions? What colour is it?  Can it be delivered? Can I trust the
			seller?  Can I refine my search criteria to find exactly what I am looking for? The
			classifieds we were using just weren't cutting it so we decided to take matters into
			our own hands. We set out to build Furnex so it would be the one stop shop for all things
			furniture related.  We hand crafted the user interface to make sure that the experience 
			addresses all the needs of the consumers which makes for a hassle free shopping 
			experience.  Want your furniture delivered? Done.  Want a verified seller? Done. 
			Want to search for that 1780 chair with that specific shade of mahogany? 
			Interesting...but done. It's time to change the way you look for your local furniture.
			Its time to shop on Furnex.
